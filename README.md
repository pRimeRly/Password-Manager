# Password Manager

This is a simple password manager built using Python's tkinter library for the GUI. The program enables users to generate highly secure passwords and store them alongside their website and email information. The stored information is kept in a JSON file, which can be encrypted using the Ceaser Cipher encryption method, ensuring that the passwords and user data remain secure and protected. With this password manager, users can confidently create strong passwords and save them for future use, without the need to remember them all.
